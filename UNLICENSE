Do whatever you want with this software; I won't sue you over it. For the sake 
of my own curiority I'd appreciate it if you let me know what you end up doing 
with it, and it would be nice if to get a little acknowledgement, but don't feel
obliged to do either. My views on copyright, copyleft and the ‘public domain’ 
can be read in far more detail (here)[https://bengoldsworthy.net/2018/03/copywrong/].

However, I am aware of the unfortunate fact that some people may be in a 
situation that requires an ‘proper’ license, replete with legalese and capital 
letters. For those people, the text of the Unlicense is reproduced below and 
should be considered the ‘official’ license under which this software is 
released.

Wherever a license is specified for anything incorporated into this software 
(e.g. code snippets, images, etc.), please respect what the license requests 
that you do and don't do with it. It stops you getting sued, which is nice, but 
it's also just polite.
